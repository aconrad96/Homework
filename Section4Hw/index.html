  <h2>Top 4 features that I would like to on the next iPhone</h2>
  <p>The iPhone has had many iterations over the years, many features have been added to iPhones over the years and it has come a long way to where we are now. Today I will be talking about what I would like to see in this years iPhone. Here are the talking points.</p>
    <ul>
  <li>Always on display</li>
  <li>Satellite communication</li>
  <li>Unbreakable display</li>
  <li>USB-C Port</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Always on Display</h3>
  <p>The always on display feature has been on Android phones for years it doesn't drain the battery in any significant way, it is a great way to get a glance of your notification and time without lighting up the screen and possibly disturbing others nearby. iPhones have always been great for preserving battery life so I think Apple would have no problem implementing this on their phones.</p>

  <h3>Satellite Communication</h3>
    <p>In the last few years Apple has been focused on privacy, security and safety so why not add satellite communication to the next iPhone? Many people go hiking, sailing or if you are just in a rural area where cellular service just isn't available, this brings up many safety concerns, not many people would have a radio. But many people do have iPhones and that is where they could add this feature.</p>

  <h3>Unbreakable Display</h3>
    <p>I don't drop my phone often but when I do I am in a sudden moment of panic due to the fears of hearing how much it would cost to repair the screen and we all know that it ends up being this outrageous price that should be criminal to charge. but I digress, I know they may never add this feature because it is probably a huge chunk of the profits they make to repair.</p>

  <h3>USB-C</h3>
    <p>When Apple first changed from their previous proprietary port on the iPhone to the now Lightning charger it was great. But in the last few year technology has vastly improved, and pretty much every smart phone except for the iPhone these days has a USB-C port. Which provides fast charging, fast transferring rates, and is just outright the standard at this point, Apple has the USB-C port on most of their products except for the iPhone. We all know Apples master plan is to remove the port altogether but that won't be for a least another couple of years, so why not add it now and remove it when the time comes? </p>
